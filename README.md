# Dessertale Application 

Dessertale is a mobile application project for my college course Cross-platform App Development.   
The project was done by a group of students including [Le Minh Nhat Dang ](https://github.com/lmndang), [Moxa Panchal](https://github.com/moxaPanchal), [Patrik Rehak
](https://github.com/soopatrik) and me.   
Dessertale uses React native framework to run on Android and IOS platforms. The app uses our own created [API](https://github.com/Mariia2373/DesserTale-API) for accessing all its data.    

Dessertale was created as an example of an app for a sweets shop. The application lets the user choose the desirable items from the Menu and add them to the Cart. The unique  feature is that users can build and customize their own sweets in the Create part of the application. 
This project focuses on helping people with health restrictions, allergies and special food requirements, so all presented items have exact nutritional information and can be made vegan, sugar or gluten-free.  

You can test how the application works on Android and IOS in [Expo](https://snack.expo.dev/@mariiaskorik/dessertale-app).
